Heisenberg
==========

This is a python program that evaluates the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian
matrix of the quantum Heisenberg model for spin chains. Then the Hamiltonian
matrix is diagonalized, and *eigenvalues* and *eigenvectors* are obtained. In
the last step, the Total Position Spread tensor is computed.

It evaluates the matrix in open, and periodic boundary conditions.

You can compare the matrix built with this program looking at the results
obtained [here](https://github.com/muammar/heisenberg/blob/master/Matrix%20calculation%20The%20Heisenberg%20model%20Matrix%20calculation%20The%20Heisenberg%20model.pdf).
